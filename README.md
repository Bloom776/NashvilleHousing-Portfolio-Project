# NashvilleHousing-Portfolio-Project

This Repository will hold all the code and queries from the NashvilleHousing-Portfolio-Project I worked on.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a data cleaning project where Nashville housing data was analyzed thoroughly and cleaned with MSSQLS to make drawing inferences easier and less complicated.
Query goals achieved include:
1. Standardizing the date format
2. Populating the Property Address data
3. Breaking out Address into individual columns (Address, City, State)
4. Changing Y and N to Yes and No in the "Sold as Vacant" field
